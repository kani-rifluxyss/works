Dear Sir,

It is with great regret that I am writing to resign from my position as a Software Developer effective 11th Jan, 2019. My employment contract requires me to serve for a notice period of 3 months / 60 working days (8th Apr, 2019).

I would like to thank you for giving me the opportunity to work with Rifluxyss Softwares Pvt Ltd. I thank you for all the efforts and apologies for any inconvenience I may have caused.

I look forward to your reply.
